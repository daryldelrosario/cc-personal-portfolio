# Practice Portfolio for CC
Creating a Personal Portoflio via CC instructions. Using this as practice, not official portfolio just yet. May eventually turn into official personal portfolio website, but we'll just have to wait and see.

## Features
- deployed via Netlify
- Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Contact form page with pseudo-form

## Notes
Tried to get firebase to connect to a simple contact html form but can not get them to connect just as yet. Will leave this project as is and revisit firebase at a later time.
